# IM-FastForward
FastForward mod for Idol Manager. Press '4' or click the fast-forward button twice to speed up time 5x faster!

This is a little example mod to demonstrate the capabilities of [IM-HarmonyIntegration](https://github.com/ui3TD/IM-HarmonyIntegration)

# IM-HarmonyIntegration Modding Tutorial

### Pre-requisites: 
- [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
- [IM-HarmonyIntegration](https://github.com/ui3TD/IM-HarmonyIntegration)
- [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (recommended)

### Getting Started:

1. Clone this git repo to download the source files here. The command will create a `IM-FastForward` folder with all the files downloaded.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ui3TD/IM-FastForward
```
2. Gather the following key .dll files into a convenient folder:
	1. `0Harmony.dll`: This file is located in the `BepInEx\core` folder of your Idol Manager directory, if you've installed IM-HarmonyIntegration.
	2. `Assembly-CSharp.dll`: This file is located in the `IM_Data\Managed` folder of your Idol Manager directory.
	3. `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll`: This file is located in the `IM_Data\Managed` folder of your Idol Manager directory.
	4. `UnityEngine.UI.dll`: This file is located in the `IM_Data\Managed` folder of your Idol Manager directory.
	5. `Unity.TextMeshPro.dll`: This file is located in the `IM_Data\Managed` folder of your Idol Manager directory.
	6. `DOTween.dll`: This file is located in the `IM_Data\Managed` folder of your Idol Manager directory.

3. Open the .csproj file `FastForward.csproj` to configure your folders.

4. Edit the value between the `ModOutputDir` paths to point to where you want to output your mods. By default it points to a folder called `Mods` alongside the `IM-FastForward` folder.
```xml
<ModOutputDir>$(SolutionDir)\..\..\Mods</ModOutputDir>
```

5. Edit the value between the `dllDir` paths to point to a folder where all your .dll files from step 2 are located. By default it points to a folder called `dll` alongside the `IM-FastForward` folder.
```xml
<dllDir>$(SolutionDir)\..\..\dll</dllDir>
```

6. Open the `FastForward.sln` file in Visual Studio.

7. Check the Solution Explorer panel on the right to make sure all your .dll files are detected under `Dependencies > Assemblies`. If they aren't then double check steps 2 and 5.

</p>

8. Check the Solution Explorer to check if required NuGet packages were automatically downloaded under `Dependencies > Packages`. If not, right click `Packages` and click `Manage NuGet Packages...` to search for and install the required NuGet packages.
You can try to run `setup_nuget_packages.bat` to do it automatically.

Required NuGet packages are:
- Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies.net46, version 1.0.3
- UnityEngine.Modules, version 2019.4.23
 
9. Build the solution by selecting `Build > Build Solution` from the top menu.

Congratulations, you've created the mod!

### Making Your Own Mod
1. Start with this and modify your file names from within the Visual Studio Solution Explorer.

2. Open the .csproj file `FastForward.csproj` to set your assembly name and mod name. The assembly name is a unique ID of your mod and will later be input into your mod's `info.json` file as the `HarmonyID`. It's recommended to use [Reverse Domain Name Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation). The mod name will be the name of the mod's folder.
```xml
<AssemblyName>com.tel.fastforward</AssemblyName>
<ModName>FastForward</ModName>
```
3. Modify all your mod's files in the `assets` folder. Remember to set up your `info.json` with the appropriate `Title` and `HarmonyID`.
```json
{
  "Title": "FastForward",
  "Description": "Press '4' or click the fast-forward button twice to go faster!",
  "Author": "Tel",
  "Version": "1.2",
  "Tags": ["gameplay"],
  "HarmonyID": "com.tel.fastforward"
}

```
4. Edit the .cs to develop your mod. Check out [this tutorial](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Mod_development_guide/Harmony) for more info, but ignore the Awake() method. IM-HarmonyIntegration does it automatically.
